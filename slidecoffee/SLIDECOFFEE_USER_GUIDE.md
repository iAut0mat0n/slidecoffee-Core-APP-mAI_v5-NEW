## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting the Best AI Results

1. **Be Specific** - "Create a 10-slide sales deck for enterprise SaaS" beats "Make a presentation"
2. **Provide Context** - Share audience, goal, and key messages
3. **Use Examples** - "Like a TED Talk style" or "Similar to Apple keynotes"
4. **Iterate** - Start broad, then refine with AI's help
5. **Review Outline** - Always check AI's plan before building

### Brand Management Tips

1. **Upload Brand Files** - Let AI extract colors/fonts automatically
2. **Create Multiple Brands** - One for each client or project
3. **Use Brand Templates** - Faster than starting from scratch
4. **Keep Logos High-Res** - Upload PNG or SVG for best quality

### Collaboration Best Practices

1. **Set Clear Permissions** - Not everyone needs edit access
2. **Use Comments** - Better than editing directly
3. **Lock Slides** - Prevent accidental changes to approved slides
4. **Save Versions** - Before major changes or sharing
5. **Use Chat** - Discuss changes before making them

### Performance Optimization

1. **Limit Slide Count** - 20-30 slides max for best performance
2. **Optimize Images** - Compress before uploading
3. **Use Templates** - Faster than custom designs
4. **Save Frequently** - Don't rely only on auto-save
